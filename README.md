Link for the website: https://techbot505.github.io/News-Article-Website/
Project: News Article Website (Frontend) 
Tech Used: Atom
The frontend is coded in HTML, CSS, and JS. I used Google Fonts to add different fonts, used FontAwesome for icons.

Frontend Explaination:
The index.html is the main file which directly links to the landing(home) page of the website. The styles.css is the CSS file. The index.js is the javascript file which provides functionality to my website. The Images folder contains all the images used in the website.
Home page consists of the following sections: Header, Main Body, Footer. The main page is linked with other pages having category wise news. I used carousel to display advertisements under the search bar section. Every anchor tag have hover efect. The header consists of 'Navigation bar' and 'Search bar' sections. The main page conatains Latest News section, Trending News Section and each news column have a button that redirects the user to teh complete article. All the buttons have hover effects and the website is completely 'RESPONSIVE'. On small screen, the navigation-bar converts into a dropdown menu which opens when we click on the hamburger-icon. I used JS Event-Listener to proceed the same. The footer section is self explainatory.

FEATURES:
The website is completely Responsive, I also used media query.
